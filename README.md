# JS30Day10_Shift_and_Checkboxes

This one was pretty difficult to grasp but is one of those litte thing we take for granted. This is all about the ability to hold shift and select multiple check boxes on a list, like say your Gmail account when you are selected multiple spam emails to delete. 

My favorite part of all of these so far has been learning the small things that I plan to incorporate into my larger projects. Also hit a milestone with this one! This is my 25th repository! 

As usual the deployed project can be found below:
